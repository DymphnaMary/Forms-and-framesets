        <p>In a tough world for the IT-enabled industries in the world, the onus on the computer engineers will be to not only develop cost effective solutions to the impending problems but also provide quality services through core technology development. A post-graduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering is invariably essential if one aspires to set himself aside in a honeycomb mass of “computer professionals” and to play a stellar role in 
            transforming the industry, be it through research, advanced development or entrepreneurship.</p>
